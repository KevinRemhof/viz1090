Android build notes

This example works:
https://github.com/pvallet/hello-sdl2-android

the only JDK that seems to work is oracle-java8-installer, discontinued but available as of 2/18/2020 from 
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ts.sch.gr/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
per https://askubuntu.com/questions/1139387/update-to-latest-version-of-java-after-ppa-is-discontinued

SDL2, SDL2_gfx, SDL2_ttf official need to go in external

SDL2_gfx official doesn't have Android.mk, but this one does:

https://github.com/keera-studios/SDL2_gfx


App parameters are in android/app/src/main/java/[pvallet/com/github/hellosdl2/helloSDL2Activity.java] (network access, fullscreen immersive mode"
Resources (fonts etc) need to go in android/app/src/main/res
build settings (arch, android version) are in android/AndroidManifest.xml AND android/SDL2/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml (not sure if the second one needs to be changed)
